## Schedule of Deliverables

Here should come a list of your milestones. This list is a start based on the
difference phases of GSoC. Use it as a start. You can/should add more details
for each phase by breaking it down into weeks or set specific targets for each
phase. Each target should be split into sub task with a time estimate, [work
breakdown structures][wbs] are helpful here.

### **Community Bonding Period**

This phase is to get to know the community better. Check that your build
environment is setup. This time should also be used to discuss your project in
more detail with the community and in general introduce it. 

*Note:* We require you to write regular blog posts. Now is a good time to make
