    "Hello, I am Ayush Pandey, a 4th year undergraduate student pursuing an Integrated Master of Science(MS) degree in Mathematics and Computing Sciences with micro-specialization in Optimization Theory and Applications\n",
    "at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am proficient in C, C++, Java and Python. I am moderately proficient in Julia.\n",

    "## Previous Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "My first encounter with the field of optimization and operation research was during my 3rd year in the college when I took a course in Operation Research. As a part of the course, we were asked to code the Linear Programming methods ([source code](https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/Linear-Programming)). I enjoyed the course a lot and since then have been reading optimization. I was also chosen to be a part of the IIT Kharagpur's contingent in [4th InterIIT TechMeet](http://interiittech.com/) where IIT Kharagpur won gold medal in Portfolio Optimization event in which the participants had to present the solution for the Cardinality Constrained Efficient Frontier which we solved using 3 heuristic methods namely Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing ([source code](https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/InterIIT-TechMeet)).\n",

In this step, we use the transformation $\\tau^{-1}$ to obtain the solution of the complex SDP from the solution of the real SDP which is obtained in step 4. Lets us assume that the primal value of the variables of the real SDP is stored in temporary variable $Y$ which is a square matrix of order $2n$. As from the transformation $\\tau^{-1}$, it can be easily verified that first $n$ columns of first $n$ rows contain the real part of the complex matrix $X$ and the next $n$ columns contain negative the imaginary part of the matrix $X$. Also, the optimum value of the complex SDP is half the optimum value of the complex SDP. Thus, I would need to implement a new function which would take the primal values and the optimum values of the real SDP and convert to the corresponding complex SDP. This would be done by creating a function which would take the user-defined type **\"Solution\"** (this contains the solution for the real SDP) as an argument and convert it to complex-domain solution. I would also be required to make our solver intelligent so that it could distinguish between real and complex-domain SDPs. This would be done by creating a new field **\"domain\"** in the user-defined type **\"Solution\"** which would take values as either **real or complex**.

    "My summer vacation will start from 30th of April. During this period, I would want to get myself more familiarized with the source code of Convex.jl. I have in particular 2 issue in mind which I would like to send the pull request to namely:\n",

    "* `Issue multiplying expressions with matrices.`[#122](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl/issues/122)\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe solving the above issue would help me strengthen my understanding of source code and make myself comfortable with contributing to the package.\n",

    "\n",
    "This would be the first step towards supporting complex numbers in Convex.jl, **kron** atom is used in Chebychev design of an FIR filter given a desired frequency response. Thus implementing this feature would make Convex.jl useful in the applications related to filter design"

We would only be able to merge the code into the existing package after all the 6 steps have been implemented. I would start by making changes in variable.jl file. The end outcome of this week would be that the users would be able to declare a variable as complex-domain variable."
