## Students

NumFOCUS is participating as a umbrella organization. This means that
you will need to identify a specific project to apply to under the
NumFOCUS umbrella. (Projects are listed below.)

Read [this document][CONTRIBUTING] to learn how to apply for the
GSoC program with NumFOCUS. Please also check out our [ideas list][IL].

For any questions, please open an issue in our [issue tracker][issues]
or send a email to gsoc@numfocus.org, our mailing list address.
Please also consider subscribing to the mailing list at
https://groups.google.com/a/numfocus.org/forum/#!forum/gsoc.

## Sub Organizations

If you want to participate as a sub organization of NumFOCUS please read

       <p>
        ArviZ is a Python package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. Includes functions for posterior analysis, sample diagnostics, model checking, and comparison. The goal is to provide backend-agnostic tools for diagnostics and visualizations of Bayesian inference in Python, by first converting inference data into xarray objects.

        Chainer is a powerful, flexible and intuitive deep learning framework. Chainer supports CUDA computation. It only requires a few lines of code to leverage a GPU. It also runs on multiple GPUs with little effort. Chainer supports various network architectures including feed-forward nets, convnets, recurrent nets and recursive nets. It also supports per-batch architectures. Forward computation can include any control flow statements of Python without lacking the ability of backpropagation. It makes code intuitive and easy to debug. </p>
