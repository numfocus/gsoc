# Google Summer of Code

| [Sub organizations](#sub-organizations) | [IDEAS LIST][IL] | [Contributor guides][CONTRIBUTING]  |

[NumFOCUS][] will be applying again as an umbrella mentoring organization
for [Google Summer of Code 2026][GSoC]. [NumFOCUS][] supports and
promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software.

[NumFOCUS][] is committed to promoting and sustaining a professional and ethical community. Our [Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) is our effort to uphold these values and it provides a guideline and some of the tools and resources necessary to achieve this.

[Google Summer of Code][GSoC] is an annual open source internship program
sponsored by Google. This repository contains information specific to NumFOCUS'
participation in GSoC. For general information about the competition, including
this year's application timeline and key phases involved, please see the [GSoC
website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/)

## Contributor

NumFOCUS is participating as a umbrella organization. This means that
you will need to identify a specific project to apply to under the
NumFOCUS umbrella. (Projects are listed below.)

Read [this document][CONTRIBUTING] to learn how to apply for the
GSoC program with NumFOCUS. Please also check out our [ideas list][IL].

For project-specific questions, contact the project directly.
Every project has a Code of Conduct and a contributing guide,
please read these before opening an issue about getting started with GSoC.
GSoC is hands-on: rather than sending introductory emails, begin by triaging or solving issues to get to know the team.
For general questions, open an issue in our [issue tracker][issues] or email gsoc@numfocus.org.
You can also subscribe to the mailing list at https://groups.google.com/a/numfocus.org/forum/#!forum/gsoc.

## AI Guidelines

At the organization level, contributors must clearly cite any AI tools used.
AI use is generally acceptable but determined by each sub-organization/project;
verify the project’s AI acceptance and guidelines before using AI.
Please read Google’s [Guidance for GSoC Contributors using AI tooling in GSoC 2026][AIGUIDE].

## Sub Organizations

If you want to participate as a sub organization of NumFOCUS please read
this [guide](CONTRIBUTING-mentors.md).

ArviZ aims to integrate seamlessly with established probabilistic programming languages like PyStan, PyMC, Turing, Soss, emcee, or Pyro. Where the probabilistic programming languages aim to make it easy to build and solve Bayesian models, the ArviZ libraries aim to make it easy to process and analyze the results from those Bayesian models.

      <p>
        Open Science Labs is a global community dedicated to creating an open space for teaching, learning, and sharing information about open science and computational tools. Our community develops tools that address real-world problems and collaborates with other projects and workgroups to improve technology and create international opportunities for our community. Although our focus may seem broad, we initially prioritize supporting Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who often face computational challenges in their work.

       <p>optimagic is a Python package for numerical optimization. It is a unified interface to optimizers from SciPy, NlOpt and other packages. optimagic's minimize function works just like SciPy's, so you don't have to adjust your code. You simply get more optimizers for free. On top you get diagnostic tools, parallel numerical derivatives and more.</p>
