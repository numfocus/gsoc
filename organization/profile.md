# Organization Profile

## Your details

-   Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

    NumFOCUS promotes and supports research and development of open-source
    computing tools. It is the fiscal sponsor for cutting-edge,
    high-profile
    data science and numeric computing tools such as numpy, pandas,
    Jupyter, Julia, and rOpenSci.

    NumFOCUS would like to participate in Google Summer of Code 2017 as an
    umbrella organization for these tools in continuance of its mission.
    By participating, we hope to provide our community with another
    opportunity
    to help develop critical pieces of the open-source data science and
    numeric computing ecosystem.

-   What would your org consider to be a successful summer?

    As an umbrella organisation for open source scientific tools, it's
    important for the projects to not just get new features implemented
    but develop a sustainable welcoming community for new contributors.
    A successful summer for us is more active new contributors to our projects.
    Previous GSoC students with NumFOCUS have ended up becoming
    core developers and maintainers of the projects.
    
-   How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

    11-15

-   How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

    We plan to engage our project leaders and students on a regular basis to
    ensure that measurable, achievable goals are set for their Summer of
    Code projects, that progress is being made toward their completion,
    and that there is clear communication of expectations and adequate
    knowledge-sharing between mentors and students.

    Our individual projects have different organizing strategies, and we
    intend to respect these, relying on our board of directors and project
    management staff to also guarantee that Summer of Code participants
    will have a positive and rewarding experience and ensure that their
    participation in these projects will have clear, tangible results.

-   How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

    We believe that measurable, achievable goals and clear, transparent
    expectations are necessary in order to ensure that both students and the
    projects have a positive experience with the Summer of Code program. To
    facilitate this, we intend to meet with project leaders and students on a
    regular basis to allow them to report any issues they have encountered. Of
    course, for day-to-day progress on issues, we intend to use tools like
    GitHub and Bugtrack.

    Furthermore, we offer students some unique opportunities to share their work
    and their progress with the broader open source scientific and numeric
    computing community. We believe that these will also serve as incentives to
    keep their projects on track with tangible, presentable results. We intend
    to offer students the opportunity to present their progress to the entire
    NumFOCUS community via blog posts hosted and distributed on NumFOCUS.org,
    via sections in our regular newsletter, and via speaking opportunities at
    conferences.

-   How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

    The NumFOCUS community is passionate, engaged, and growing.
    We have many conferences and chapters (meetups) planned for 2017
    around the world.
    We will offer students the
    opportunity to present their work at one of those conferences
    or chapter meetups
    and facilitate connections to allow them to
    present their work at other non-affiliated events.

    Furthermore, we intend to ask students to present their progress to
    our
    community on a regular basis. We will promote these progress reports
    via
    the NumFOCUS newsletter, Twitter feed, and our public blog.

-   How will you keep students involved in your community after GSoC?

    We intend to invite GSoC participants to present their work at future
    conferences and chapter meetups that we support. Additionally, individual
    projects under NumFOCUS have their own respective communities, and
    have
    historically had great experiences involving and engaging volunteer
    contributors.

-   Description

    NumFOCUS supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source
    scientific software. Most individual projects, even the wildly successful
    ones, find the overhead of a non-profit to be too large for their community
    to bear. NumFOCUS provides a critical service as an umbrella organization
    for this projects.
