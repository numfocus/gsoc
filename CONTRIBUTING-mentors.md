# Contributing Guide for Mentors and Sub Orgs
## Organizations Eligible Under NumFOCUS Umbrella

All the projects listed [here][NumFOCUS-Projects].
Other projects should send a email to gsoc@numfocus.org.

To participate under the NumFOCUS umbrella,
a sub-org must:

1. Have one sub-org admin
   and at least two mentors (**the sub-org admin can be one of the mentors**)
   who are willing to commit to the full GSoC period.
2. Must be a NumFOCUS sponsored or affiliated project
3. Have a good ideas page.

The sub org administrator and has the responsibility to communicate with
NumFOCUS and advertise GSoC to the community of their organization.

You can signup as a participating org with us until the application deadline for
the current year or up to 5 days after Google announces that NumFOCUS is
participating as a umbrella org.

When you sign-up with us you should also tell us your preferred way for students
to contact you and a link to your new contributor page if you have one.

## Sub Org Administrators

Each project/organization under NumFOCUS umbrella for GSoC should have one
administrator.

The **sub-org admins** are responsible for

- provide a list of projects ideas to **organization administrator**
- advertise the application to the project/organization they represent
- connect users with NumFOCUS profile
- request to **organization administrator** a minimum and a maximum number of
  slots
- assign mentors and students to available slots

## Mentors

To be a mentor please tell your sub-org administrator so he can give you all the
information you need to sign up.

## Projects

Please make sure that the project can be partly completed during the summer so
that students pass the final evaluation. Please also read
the [student guide][CS], especially our requirements from students.

There has to be at least one primary mentor and one backup mentor per project.
This means you should have at least 2 mentors available. A mentor can only be
'primary' for one student but a backup for as many as he likes.

If you have a proposal you can use our [proposal templates][template] and publish the ideas
list here or you can link to an ideas list on one of your own websites/repositories.

To publish your project ideas here follow this guide.

1.  copy `YYYY/ideas/skeleton.md` to `YYYY/ideas/title-of-my-proposal.md`
    where `YYYY` is the currently year
    and `title-of-my-proposal` is a sort version of the title of your proposal.
2.  add a link to `YYYY/ideas/title-of-my-proposal.md` at `YYYY/ideas-list.md`.
3.  send a pull request with the changes at `YYYY`.
4.  [create an issue](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/issues/new)
    where students can ask questions.
